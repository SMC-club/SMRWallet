# SMRWallet
Lightweight wallet for SMR with Qt based interface 
Only 64-bit operation systems are supported.

## Build instructions

### Windows
1. Install Visual Studio Community 2017 with C++ and Windows SDK.
2. Setup Git for Windows.
2. Download the dependency archive and unpack it to C:\MyProjects\ directory.
3. Run qmake_env_static.cmd and use opened command prompt for the next actions.
3. Clone this repository:
    git clone http://github.com/RussianMiningCoin/SMRWallet
4. Run the following commands:
```
    cd SMRWallet
    mkdir build
    cd build && qmake ..
    nmake
```    
5. You're done ;)

### Mac OS X
1. Install Apple XCode and setup Homebrew
2. Download Qt for Mac OS  from the official site and setup it as usual.
3. Install the following Homebrew packages:
    brew install boost openssl cmake protobuf scons
4. Clone and build ripple-libpp:
```
    git clone https://github.com/RussianMiningCoin/smr-libpp
    cd smr-libpp && git update submodule --init --recursive
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. && make
    cd ../..
```
5. Clone this repository and open SMRWallet.pro in Qt Creator.
6. You should be able to build your project as usual. If it doesn't work then ensure that smr-libpp tree is sharing parent directory with SMRWallet project.

### Other NIXes
Should be similar to OS X steps. You may also need to build boost 1.66 though. Please consider reading smr-libpp build instructions first.
